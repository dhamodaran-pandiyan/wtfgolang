All kinds of patches are welcome. Feel free to even suggest some catchy and funny titles for the existing Examples. The goal is to make this collection as interesting to read as possible. Here are a few ways through which you can contribute,

- If you are interested in translating the project to another language (some people have done that in the past), please feel free to open up an issue, and let me know if you need any kind of help.
- If the changes you suggest are significant, filing an issue before submitting the actual patch will be appreciated. If you'd like to work on the issue (highly encouraged), you can mention that you're interested in working on it while creating the issue and get assigned to it.
- If you're adding a new example, it is highly recommended to create an issue to discuss it before submitting a patch.
